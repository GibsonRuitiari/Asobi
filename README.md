# Asobi

Asobi  in japanese means 'play'.
Asobi is a comic application that allows one to read
english comics from the likes of dc, marvel, image, one-shot comics, basically it is a market of comics that borrows its inspiration
from other platforms such as Tayichomi.

The app is still in progress and under heavy development.
It employs the use of recommended architectures (mvvm) and jetpack libraries.

## Tech stack used

-Jetpack libraries

-Kotlinx coroutines library

-Multidex library

-Glide

-Jsoup

-Okhttp

-Lottie

-Koin

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to test my knowledge in android-view system. A quick glance at the whole project and you will realize
most views are created dynamically rather than statically (xml).
Also, the other purpose is to tinker with existing jetpack libraries and put my knowledge to the test.
Testing is not yet done but it is to be implemented with time

The project is far from perfect and there are still errors, that being said if you find issues with
the project please don't fail to raise a pr.


## How the application looks like
